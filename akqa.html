        	<div class="project_description">
	        	<p class="f0">As a Creative Technologist, I was embedded on design sprint teams to tackle briefs from AKQAâ€™s clients. The expectation each sprint was to holistically understand a problem space and combine new technology with macro industry trends to generate branded experiences or products.</p>
	        	<p class="f0">During these sprints I designed user flows, high-fidelity mockups and prototypes, I synthesized research and generated insights, and I prepared presentation decks which I pitched directly to the clients.</p>
	        	<p class="f0">Unfortunately, much of my work at AKQA is under NDA, so I cannot speak directly to the experiences created. However, I can proudly say that my work was always well-received by the clients, and I even earned new business for AKQA.</p>
                <p class="f0">Some of the clients I worked directly with are shown above.</p>

        	<div class="project_description">
	        	<p class="f0">While working in the San Francisco tech industry, my colleagues and I were stunned by the poor representation of women in the sector. We realized that the only people who could change the developer community was the developer community.</p>
	        	<p class="f0">We gained AKQAâ€™s sponsorship to pursue this problem, and built a program that capitalized on the recent microtransactional trend. We launched Develop{Her}, a program that enabled Developers to passively make micro-donations (5-25 cents) to GirlsWhoCode every time they merged their work on Github. GirlsWhoCode is a non-profit on a mission to close the gender gap in technology.</p>
	        	<p class="f0">Alongside the development of the idea and feature set, I contributed UX flows and wireframes to help bring the concept to life.</p>

        	<div class="project_description">
	        	<p class="f0">Alongside client support, AKQA encouraged employees to always generate and prototype inventive ideas. One such idea that I fabricated was a smart whistle that pings a mobile app when it is blown. My intent was to make a sentimental, tactile device for connecting with others. It also has implications as a life saving device.</p>
                <p class="f0">I worked with a development team to design and build a front end web experience that interacticted with the whistle, as well as 3D printed multiple physical prototypes to house the hardware. One of the prototypes is shown above.
	        	<p class="f0">I presented my product and application to the staff of AKQA, with a favorable response from the team. However, the product never evolved beyond prototype phase.</p>
