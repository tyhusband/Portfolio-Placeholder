                <p>From 2015-2016, I was hired as the Design Coordinator for Embark Sustainability, a non-profit organization in Burnaby, Canada that organized environmental initiatives for Simon Fraser University.</p>
                <p>I helped them translate a recent rebrand to all their assets, as well as produce countless social, web, and print materials to promote various events and initiatives.</p>

                <p>In both November 2015 and 2016, I volunteered as a peer mentor to help design students participating an urban design competition in Seattle.
                <p>During the weekend-long charrette, I helped conduct an architectural tour of Seattle area spaces and buildings, as well as provide directional feedback and support for one of the teams. I also participated in final critique of the competing projects.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed connecting with the design community, sharing my interest in urban design, and helping mentor new designers.</p>
